Introduction:
This project showcases an interactive feature for the iPhone 13 Pro Max, allowing users to explore its color options. At the bottom of the page, you will find all the available colors of the device, and by clicking on any of them, the background color of the page dynamically changes to match the selected iPhone color. Built using vanilla CSS and JavaScript, this simple yet engaging feature offers a fun way to visualize the different color variants of the iPhone 13 Pro Max.
